Variety: Sorting Reddit Posts for Content Diversity
===================================================

Variety takes a user’s subscribed subreddits and re-ranks threads in order to
place threads with diverse content at the top. Threads that receive high scores
according to Variety’s ranking algorithms are those that have multifaceted
discussion (e.g.: individual posts on a thread show a diversity of political
opinion) and where interlocutors are reasonable, as determined by sentiment
analysis. It is our hope that by using Variety, users will be able to consider
all sides of an issue before creating an informed opinion rather than blindly
parroting echo chamber opinions.
